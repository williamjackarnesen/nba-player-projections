# Best Games of the Past 10 Years

This post looks at the best individual player performances of the past 10 years. Because games that went to overtime dominated the overall rankings, I have normalized them so the scores are per-48 minutes. As a result, all but two games (#4 Monta Ellis and #10 Draymond Green) occured during a game that did not go to overtime.
