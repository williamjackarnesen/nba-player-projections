# Mid-Season Awards

In honor of tonight's upcoming announcement on the list of All-Star starters, I felt it apropo to include the list of players our model thinks ought be All-Stars. Considering that a 28-30 game sample size is insufficient to judge someone's full All-Star worthiness, I decided to throw in some adjustment for player skill (2/3rds weight to performance-to-date, 1/3rd weight on skill). This adjustment a) probably allows these picks to age a bit better and b) more accurately captures voter behavior in rewarding players who have consistently put up great numbers, even if their availability this year has been less than optimal. I have included 13 for each conference in recognizance of the possibility of an alternate being necessary (or, in the case of the Western Conference, highly likely).

## Western Conference All-Stars

The Western Conference All-Star roster has few surprises. The five projected starters (the top 4 plus Kawhi Leonard for the last forward spot) are the five who are currently leading in the most recent publicly-released fan voting. The only "surprises" occur at the end of the list, where Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, San Antonio's DeMar DeRozan and New Orleans's Brandon Ingram (as first alternate) edge out other worthy contenders like Dejounte Murray and Zion Williamson (the first two left off). 

The more notable omissions include Phoenix's Devin Booker and Utah's Donovan Mitchell, who the model thinks have played closer to above-average starter levels than All-Star level (Mitchell has been 58th on the year in wins added, while Booker is 83rd). These results are actually decently similar to 538's results, who have Mitchell at #31 and Booker at #74. The largest gap between 538's projections and ourselves are from the Jazz's Mike Conley (7th on 538, 50th for us), the Spurs' Jakob Poeltl (15th on 538, 155th for us) and the Clippers' Nicolas Batum (18th on 538, 53rd for us). In contrast, we are relatively bullish on DeRozan (27th for us, 81st for 538), Gilgeous-Alexander (30th v 67th) and Ingram (26th v 61st).

Obviously, team record is a major factor in All-Star selections. Teams at the top of the standings (like Utah) are likely to be rewarded with multiple All-Stars while voters may be more remiss to allocate a spot to a player on a middling team like Oklahoma City. These projections do not take these factors into account. In other words, they are less projections of what the voters will pick but rather claims about who they should pick. 


## Eastern Conference All-Stars

These Eastern Confernce results differ greatly from the public consensus. Despite playing in the nation's largest market, the New York Knicks' Julius Randle languishes a distant 8th in fan voting for the East frontcourt, despite ranking second by our metric. A couple factors--including the Knicks' so-so record and Randle's history of being an average-but-not-great player--probably harm him in popular consideration. But perhaps the largest factor is availability--while voters may reward a player like Kevin Durant (first in voting for all Eastern players) for his stellar play on the court, a string of health and safety protocol and injury-related absences have meant he has only played 18 full games, compared to 30 for Randle. Even though Durant is a far more effective than Randle when playing, it is hard to make up such a vast minutes differential (even despite adding a fudge factor for player skill).

In addition, the Orlando Magic's Nikola Vucevic doesn't even crack the top 10 in fan voting for the Eastern frontcourt, despite leading our list of Eastern centers for the year. While the Magic's poor record (and small market size) probably harms him in the popular imagination, our results suggest his efforts this year carrying the snake-bitten team to an 11-18 record despite a rash of injuries to major contributors is worthy of All-Star consideration.

In contrast, we are relatively bearish on a series of former All-Stars players largely due to lack of playing time, including Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Kemba Walker and even Jayson Tatum. Meanwhile, our model just rates some high-availibility fan favorites as sub-All Stars, including Trae Young (34th in performance overall), Bradley Beal (38th) and Jaylen Brown (49th). Besides playing time, the model seems to differ most from consensus by not heavily rewarding points scored (which harms players like Joel Embiid and Bradley Beal) in favor of players with more assists (like James Harden and Ben Simmons).

We are most bearish relative to 538 on a series of centers: Joel Embiid (2nd on 538, 21st for us), Clint Capela (15th on 538, 40th for us) and Myles Turner (18th for 538, 63rd for us). Meanwhile, we are more bullish on players like Ben Simmons (43rd on 538, 13th for us), Zach LaVine (61st on 538, 19th for us) and Domantas Sabonis (212th for 538, 10th for us). The latter gap is the largest in our set.
